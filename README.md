# IPhoneFileRenameTool
Simple app for renaming media files. 
The main gola of the app is to rename media files so that the name will contain the date on with the photo/video was taken. 
Additionaly you can add a postifix to the name to distinguish between different soources (photso downloaded from different devices).
Another feature let's you automaticly conver HEIC to JPEG. 

The app was created because i got frustreated by managing media files from diffrent iPhones on my Windows PC. 
iPhone by default names camera files using IMG_ convention. When you download those media files to PC the order gets mixed. 
Addiniotanly if you have media files form other apps it will rename them to {GUID}.{extension} with is even more frustrating. 

The app was created in couple of hours so it will require some additional work to polish.

Some basic features that are still miessing:
- progress bar
- checkbox to turn on/turn off logging
- icon
- installer
