# IPhoneFileRenameTool
Simple app for renaming media files. The main goal of the app is to rename media files so that the name will contain the date on which the photo/video was taken. Additionally, you can add a postfix to the name to distinguish between different sources (photos downloaded from different devices). Another feature lets you automatically convert HEIC to JPEG.

The app was created because I got frustrated by managing media files from different iPhones on my Windows PC. iPhones by default name camera files using the IMG_ convention. When you download those media files to your PC, the order gets mixed. Additionally, if you have media files from other apps, it will rename them to GUID.extension, which is even more frustrating.

The app was created in a couple of hours, so it will require some additional work to polish.

Some basic features that are still missing:
- progress bar
- checkbox to turn on or off logging
- icon
- installer
